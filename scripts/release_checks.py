# This module ships into the public repo, where checks 4 and 5 scan every file in
# the tree -- this one included. Spelling either value out as a plain literal would
# make the checker fail on its own source. Assembling them is what lets both checks
# stay absolute: no exemption list, no self-skip, nothing to keep in step.

# DO NOT join these concatenations back into single strings, and do not quote the
# assembled values anywhere in this file -- comments and docstrings are scanned too.
# test_release_checks.py reads this file's own source and asserts neither value
# appears in it, so a tidy-up fails there rather than silently at release time.
